This application has been developed using ASP.NET Core 8 with a SQL Server database. The dropdown lists in the application are populated directly from the database tables.

Before launching the application, it is essential to run the SQL scripts to create the required database objects and insert the necessary data.

Data Annotations have been implemented for validation, so all inputs must strictly comply with the defined validation rules.
